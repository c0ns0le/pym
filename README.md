His academic homepage (<https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/staff/RobertTobler.html>,

Given that Dr. Tobler was a professor, I am proceeding under the good-faith 
assumption that the code is available under open-source terms.  Anyone with 
information to the contrary is heartily invited to open an issue here.
